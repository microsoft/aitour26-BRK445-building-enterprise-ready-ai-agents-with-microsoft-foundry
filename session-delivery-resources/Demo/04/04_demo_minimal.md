1. Scope: Demonstrates using Azure Monitor (Application Map) to locate application issues, and how to correlate those findings with AI Foundry tracing and Azure AI Monitor. [00:00:02 – 00:00:10]
2. Use the Application Map to find the highlighted node and expand the summary (errors / latency / anomalies). [00:00:12 – 00:00:16]
3. Perform a deep dive with Azure AI Monitor to observe a single-agent call interruption or failures at a specific time. [00:00:31 – 00:00:46]
4. Identify a model or third-party service outage (example: suspected GPT‑5 / GPT5 mini chat outage). [00:00:46 – 00:00:57]
5. Correlate tracing and monitoring data: compare Azure Monitor call logs with AI Foundry tracing to locate failing requests and determine root cause. [00:00:51 – 00:01:06]
6. Next steps: capture trace IDs, logs, and screenshots; create verification tasks with timestamps and priority for engineering follow-up. [00:01:06 – 00:01:30]
