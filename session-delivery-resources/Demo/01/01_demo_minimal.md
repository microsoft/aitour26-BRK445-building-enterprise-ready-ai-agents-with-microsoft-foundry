1. Scope: Demonstrates AI Foundry project capabilities — agent/playground management, agent creation, and end-to-end integrations. [00:00:02 – 00:00:09]
2. Agents overview: Review the list of available agents (multi-agent orchestrator, navigation agent, product/inventory agents) and existing agent templates. [00:00:15 – 00:00:29]
3. Create an agent: define a name, choose a model (GPT / other vendors), and provide a system prompt. [00:00:30 – 00:00:39]
4. Data & connectors: Connect agents to external data sources (Azure AI Search, SharePoint, Bing), third-party APIs (OpenAPI), and integrate with Azure Functions / Logic Apps. [00:00:52 – 00:01:58]
5. Playground demo: Run the inventory agent with a tailored sample prompt (e.g., search for customer "John Smith"). The agent calls external services (Azure Search) and returns structured JSON results; thread logs show the call flow. [00:02:34 – 00:03:48]
6. Management & observability: Use the project management center for user access and connected resources; traceability is available (model/agent traces). The demo uses a GPT‑5 mini model and shows web requests to LLM and database lookups. [00:03:59 – 00:05:27]
